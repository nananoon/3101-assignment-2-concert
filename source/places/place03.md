description: Situated in the heart of the Civic District, the Gallery is housed in two national monuments—City Hall and former Supreme Court. Both have been beautifully restored and transformed into a magnificent 64,000 square metre venue. Reflecting Singapore’s unique heritage and geographical location, the Gallery presents Southeast Asian art within the global context. We work with international museums such as Centre Pompidou, Musée d'Orsay, Tate Britain, National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo (MOMAT), and National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea (MMCA), to positioning Singapore as a key node player in the global visual arts scene around the world.
