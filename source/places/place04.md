description: The Pink Palace, rather known as the Beverly Hills Hotel is located in the heart of Beverly Hills, in the heart of ultra-luxury. Many may not know this but the land the hotel sits on was once owned by the Mexican government. It’s what anyone who hasn’t been to the Los Angeles area might envision it to be. The style and ambience of the hotel is unlike anything one might expect. Sitting on twelve acres of gardens, ensconced behind banana leaves and quintessential tall and skinny LA Palm trees, it has seen a lot of Hollywood life since 1912. A Dorchester Collection hotel, The Beverly Hills Hotel is a part of a family of eight hotels and two to come, one in Dubai next year and one in Tokyo in five years. The décor is unlike anything and the hotel’s fashion items are enviable.
