description: The Jones Beach Theater has a history stretching back to the 1930s, evolving from a wooden marine stadium for aquatic shows to a major concert venue. Originally named the Jones Beach Marine Theater, it was rebuilt in 1952 after its predecessor was deemed unsafe. The venue has undergone significant renovations since, expanding its capacity and modernizing over time, including a major reconstruction after Superstorm Sandy in 2012.
